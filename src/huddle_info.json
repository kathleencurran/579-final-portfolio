      "huddleBackground": "Huddle sought to improve interaction (social, academic, and professional) among students in the U-M School of Information (UMSI) and provide a comprehensive archive of resource for students to access."

    {
      "framing": "First, I decided on a focus (peer-to-peer support) and did some research both on the issue, and to see if any tools existed currently that addressed the issue. Based on my research, I decided to focus on graduate students, because it seemed that most research focused on undergraduates. I came up with a goal for my project: to create a platform where first year School of Information students could access information from other students. From here, I came up with a short list of possible solutions, including features, constraints, and possible users."

    {
      "needfinding": "I interviewed five people who were in my user group (graduate students at UMSI). Before the interviews, I prepared a list of questions and follow-up questions. These all reflected to the overarching question: What kinds of interactions are you looking for at UMSI, and what solutions could help you get the experiences you’re looking for? During my interviews I found several repeating opinions and needs. Based on these, I slightly redirected my direction to include both social interaction and access to resources to align better with my users’ needs."
